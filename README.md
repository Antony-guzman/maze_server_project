### Project  overview-

This is the implementation of an application to simulate avatars locating each other in a maze that is
generated by a remote server. The client application requests a specific number of avatars and a maze of a certain level of difficulty. THe server then sends the client program a maze with the walls and position of other avatars unknown to each avatar. The maze is a perfect maze ie. there is only one path between any two points in the maze. The program is suppo
sed to implement an algorithm that brings all the avatars to the same position on the maze.

### Usage

The BASIX 'maze solver' can be executed from the command line after the appropriate creation of the executable via 'make.' Command line syntax is as follows: ```./AMStartup -n (number of Avatars) -d (difficulty integer) -h (hostname)```. For our operations, the same hostname is used every time, ```-h flume.cs.dartmouth.edu```.
*Note: The ```difficulty``` input must be an integer between 0 and 9. Additionally, you can't have more than ten avatars roaming the maze so ```nAvatars``` must be between 2 and 10.

The user should not be required to input anything else for proper execution of the program; instead, a series of output files should be created containing a variety of information about the programs execution.

When printing the maze, due to the varying size possibilities, the maze's 'image' can range from very small to very large (as each 'cell' within the maze has identical dimensions but the mazes do not. The default ```int mazeScale``` is set to 3 (symbolizing tha there are three spaces vertically and horizontally for each 'cell'; a scale of 3 does not work for mazes past difficulty 4 unless you are able to expand your terminal's viewport extensively. For maze's of difficulty 5+, it is recommended to set the ```int mazeScale``` to 2.
*NOTE: ```int mazeScale``` can not be equal to or less than 1, increasing the value past 3 expands the maze, potentially causing viewport issues if the viewport is not large enough to handle the maze's size*

### Implementation

The maze is represented visually in the terminal using print statements to a provided ```FILE *file```. The implementation for this portion is as follows:
    - Get the ```mazeWidth``` and ```mazeHeight``` of the maze
    - Scale both by a passed parameter, ```int mazeScale```
    - The function prints top to bottom, checking for particular scaled X and Y coordinates and printing the appropriate symbol given the position
      - Checking for vertical and horizontal walls previously discovered
      - Checking for avatars in theh given position
      - Checking for the boundries and wall 'corners' of the current maze

Solving the maze is solved using the following algorithm psuedocode:
 - All avatars are loaded into their initial positions inside the maze
 - Avatar 0 is told to stay in position; all other avatars will discover the maze in search of Avatar 0
 - Iterating through the avatars, all avatars attempt to move East (or right)
 - If unable to move due to a maze boundary, prefer directions in the following order: South, North, West
 - If valid move attempted within maze and no change in position, build wall and place wall in set of walls
 - If in a position with walls on three sides (a dead end), step out of the position and wall it off, given there are no Avatars currently in the position, thus eliminating that square as a valid position for other avatars
 - If any given avatar moves to the position of Avatar0, stop movement and wait for other avatars
 - Once all avatars are in the same position, the maze is solved and exit


### Assumptions
 - We assume that, given the algorithm can solve simple maze representations, more complex mazes can be solved with enough time, steps, and memory
 - The maze is perfect; any given point can be reached from any other given point within the provided height and width of the structure
 - The maze is solvable in a reasonable time frame
 - Barring first moves, no attempts are made outside the boundaries of the maze 

### Compilation

To compile, simply run `make`

To clean up, run `make clean`


### Output

 - A sample of the expected output can be found within the [(unique username).log] files created after operation
 - An additional sample output will be provided --> [testing.out]
 - A visual representation of the maze should be printed out to an additional file, which should include discovery of the walls and progress of the avatars until the maze is solved
